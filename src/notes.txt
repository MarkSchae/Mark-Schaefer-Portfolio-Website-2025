Drop down nav bar for mobile
Do not forget to gitignore the node_modules

I want to add a window into my more fun/hobby side when clicked

Which projects to polish:
    Task manager/remember app
    The django typing game
    The e commerce site
    Maybe the social media one 
    Create a new project with django/python back and react/js front and do the Figma design for this project 
    Using viewport units is problematic 
    Naming conventions are not good enough

UNFORTUNATLEY MOST OF THIS WILL NEED TO BE REFACTORED. The beauty of learning.

Need to add a href to a page about my hobbies etc

Change color theme and photos 
    Host projects and link to those
    A seperate get to know me better page 
    General cleaning up 
    But main focus is to my skills and projects 
    Need to add/change the page that highlights my skills in a effective manner
        What can i bring to the table specifically
        Maybe part of the get to know me more would be books I am reading
            Technologies I am intersted in and currently learning more about 
            Etc about me 
Add some sort of hand designed Figma 
Also need to add a project taken from dirty to clean arch
